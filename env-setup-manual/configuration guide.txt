// webpack will take src files and write to distribution directory when rdy for production
// webpack and babel config next
// Need to tell webpack to invoke babel on any file that has .js so babel can run on them before webpack includes them in the bundle up
// - It's a rule: every file that ends in .js and not in node_modules folder
// need to run server and files now (from package.json scripts section)
for dev-bundle task, wd will run in dev environment
